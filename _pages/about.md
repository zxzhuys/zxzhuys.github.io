# Personal Info
I am currently a Master's student at The University of Tokyo. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Zhejiang University, China.

My academic interest mainly centers on energy systems, specifically energy system management and energy economics. My masterâ€™s research will explore potential topics regarding the synergistic integration and optimization of hydrogen, electric vehicles, and renewable energy in energy systems, especially in multigeneration systems.

Additionally, I gained research experience in control of electrical machines, power electronics, and power system analysis during my undergraduate studies.

Beyond academics, I enjoy tennis, photography, jogging, and snorkeling. My interests also include tokusatsu films, anime, and history.

If you share any of these passions, I'd be delighted to connect and exchange thoughts!
