# Greetings!
I'm Zixuan ZHU, currently pursuing my Master's degree at [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/). I completed my undergraduate studies in [Electrical Engineering and Automation at Zhejiang University](http://ee.zju.edu.cn/englishee/main.htm), China.

## Academic Interests
My primary academic interests lie in the field of **energy systems**, with a particular focus on **energy system management** and **energy economics**. For my master's research, I am excited to explore the synergistic integration and optimization of **hydrogen**, **electric vehicles**, and **renewable energy** in energy systems, especially in **multigeneration systems**.

During my undergraduate studies, I was also fortunate to gain some research experience in **control of electrical machines**, **power electronics**, and **power system analysis**.

## Hobbies
Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing tennis, photography, jogging, and snorkeling. I also have a keen interest in Tokusatsu films, anime, and history.

If you share any of these passions, Iâ€™d be delighted to connect and exchange thoughts!
